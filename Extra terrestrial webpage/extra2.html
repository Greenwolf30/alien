<p>looks like if you came here and you are reading this you have come to my website.
1. The terrestial human race is entering and witnessing a phase of very powerful
cosmic change.It is a new Era,a new age,which continually and distinctly becomes clearer 
to the eyesof the observant,concioiusly more advanced human biengs</p>
<p><strong>Lets Get started!</strong> you made it thus far so heres what this website is about
2. While most of mankind here on earth lies in deep abyss of ignorance and of 
concousness' enslavment,it has become an urgent necessity,thorough thorough investigations,
to find causes of mankinds decline,and to demonstrate this to<em> human biengs</em> in a correct
,clear and revealing message and lesson.</p>
<h5><a name="Stuff"></a>More Stuff...</h5>
<p><em>Simultaneaously</em>,it necessitates showing new ways,which would guide mankind toward future
of conscious comprehension and harmony.</p>
<p>It is now time,therefore,for the Earthlings to open his eyes and ears and detach his enslaved thoughts from false teachings,to free himself from traditional falshoods and all evil, and to finally comprehend
everything according to the truth.</p>

<h2> <a name= "Intro"></a>Introduction to Spiritual Teaching</h2>
<p> It is now the time to speak of things, that are, in the sense of the consciousness- and the spiritual development of the Earth human, very important. 
  In this regard, I do not wish to get to any questions, unless they are in relation to following presentation, which you will please understand. 
  The human bears a spirit that does not die nor sleep during the deepest sleep; it records all thoughts and motions; it informs the human whether his thoughts are correct or false—if he has learned to pay attention. 
  The spirit within the human is the bearer of the creative realm, and every human has his own (spirit). 
</p>
<p> It is incomprehensible that the human speaks of a heaven and of a kingdom of heaven within himself, rather than to merely say: Creation, truth, knowledge, wisdom, spirit, consciousness and existence. 
  A human's yearning lies in the joy that remains, for the imperishable life, the permanent peace, the spiritual and consciousness-related wealth that never fades and lasts forever. 
  Heaven and Earth will perish, but truth, knowledge, wisdom and spirit will never be changing [change?] or perish. 
  The spirit and the consciousness are on the look-out for what is perfect, for harmony, for peace, cognition and realization, for knowledge, wisdom, truth and beauty, for love and for the true BEING, all of which are of absolute duration. 
  All of these lead to what forms the spiritual kingdom of wisdom; all are existing within what is creative. 
  All of these are here in existence, as a genius of all ingenuity, as a melody of all melodies, as ability of all abilities, as the highest creative principle, as wonder of all wonders. 
  The human may create wondrous worlds in a dream, just as Creation consciously creates the worlds. 
  To the human, this capability arises from his consciousness, which is obtainable in existence within himself, in the same way that all wonders are available within himself.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pofb4BXydUc">This will be a link to a Youtube Video about Aliens from alpha Centuri</a></p>

<p> He himself is the realm of heaven, the realm of what is creative. 
  That's why the terrestrial philosophers of old spoke about the human as a microcosm within a macrocosm because everything that is included within the universe is included within the human. 
  The inner dimensions of the human are endless. 
  The image of Creation, the spirit within him—the existence that is without dimension—it bears all dimensions within itself and, at the same time, transcends all dimensions. 
  The spirit is the wonder of all wonders, and all power emerges from it. 
  A wonder means using the spirit force in perfection. 
  The human, however, places a wonder into something for which he lacks all possibilities of a logical explanation. 
  If a human is happy, his happiness comes from within, because happiness is a self-created state; never is happiness a location. 
  Joy comes forth from the human's inner part, created by spiritual poise.</p>
<p> Therefore, everything comes from within. 
  The things that, or humans who, seemingly form the cause of happiness, are only the external occasion to bring the happiness within the human expressing itself, if he has spiritually worked towards this. 
  But happiness is something that belongs to the inner being, and it is an unseparable characteristic of the spirit's existence. 
  Endless happiness and endless power are included in this existence. 
  Outwardly, the human may be old, but this is only a passing matter. 
  Fifty years ago he wasn't, and in fifty years—when his body is dead—he will not be, because only the body may become old and infirm. 
  The spirit, however, remains forever young and suffers no symptoms of old age.</p> 
  <p>29.  The old age, and also youth and infancy, and also sorrows, grief or problems, is something that passes, like it is the case with all external conditions and experiences of the world. 
 What is lasting is the existence of the spirit, truth, knowledge, wisdom, reality. 
 What matters is to recognize and build them, because they only make the human free. 
 If the human recognizes the existence of his spirit, the old age is not harmful to him any longer. 
 No sorrows, no suffering, no problem, no changes and no ups and downs of life and of the surroundings, of the environment and the world may still throw him into grief. 
 Wisdom is an elemental, tremendous power. 
 Wisdom is light. 
 And wherever a light shines, darkness and ignorance vanish. 
 But ignorance is the actual darkness, and it is overcome by the light of wisdom. 
 Wisdom is a characteristic of the existence of the spirit and the consciousness, and it bears within itself the qualities of happiness, truth, knowledge, balance, beauty, harmony and peace. 
 Wisdom is light.<br />

  <q>
 However, wisdom is the characteristic of a human who has recognized the existence of his spirit and cooperates along with the spiritual laws. 
 Wisdom is using the spirit force. 
 Wisdom and spirit are two things that amount to one, in the same way as sunlight and the sun are two things. 
 The sunlight results from the heat of the sun, which she herself first has to generate through her processes. 
 Thus, there is also an all-creating existence in the universe that, on the strength of its force, creates forces that constantly and imperturbably follow and enliven the endless eons—as truth, knowledge and wisdom, (and) according to a given uniform guideline—along certain Creative laws. 
 This forceful existence, however, is Creation. 
 And therefore, there is only one existence that rules throughout the universe—only one Creation, only one truth, one knowledge and one wisdom—and that is synchronous and unchanging for all times. 
 The eternal truth is not subject to any variations and changes, and its laws must never be revised and adjusted to new times. 
 The spirit force is vital and dynamic, namely in such an amount as it embodies the wisdom within itself. 
 It is a sign of human weakness when religions and their false teachings are presented as instruments of what is creative, and when wisdom becomes unreal through this. 
 The human searches elsewhere for strength, freedom, joy and light, but not where they really may be found. 
 Wisdom is a distinguishing feature of Creation that, as a fragment, inhabits the human as spirit.</q>-<cite>samjase</cite></p>



 <p>52. Therefore, the human shall increase his knowledgeable wisdom, and he will recognize Creation. 
53. He shall increase his search for truth, and he shall know about the power of wisdom. 
54. Cognition of the truth brings liberation from all restrictions. 
55. It brings boundless knowledge and wisdom. 
56. Wisdom is a powerful means to recognize the laws of Creation. 
57. A human who is filled with love is also rich in wisdom, and a human who is rich in wisdom is also full of love. 
58. However, the human cheats himself because he does not know love. 
59. He interprets grasping feelings and sentiments as love, while, to him, real love remains strange and not understood. 
60. A human is a human only if he has recognized truth, knowledge and wisdom, even if he never used the word Creation, because wisdom is also love in its best form.

133.  He then does not simply see a man anymore, a woman, a girl or a child, but he sees the fellowman as a bearer of a creative spirit that knows about itself, about its existence, and wants to reveal itself through anybody if there would only be offered an opportunity. 
134.  He who knows the truth sees his fellowman from this knowledge and recognition, because he sees in him what is creative. 
135.  At least he now knows more than he knew before he recognized the truth. 
136.  This is the proof then that ignorance is nothing that cannot be changed for all times. 
137.  If the human is willing to accept the truth he can free himself from all ignorance. 
138.  The human can free himself from everything, and everything can be taken from him, except the creative consciousness, the spirit, the existence within his interior, this purely spiritual realm within him. 
139.  He may be robbed from all of his possessions and may be driven away from his home, but nobody may drive him away from his spiritual realm within his interior. 
140.  Thus, the human should be constantly aware of what is creative, without which he would not be able to draw a single breath, could grasp no thought, could not realize, see, hear or experience. </p>

<p>191.  But when the human identifies himself with everything in the universe, no hate and no greed may dwell within him anymore, because he makes no more selfish differences. 
192.  He has just become one with the essence in everything. 
193.  Other people may claim something as their exclusive property, but he who thinks spiritually identifies it with the truth within and, therefore, owns everything internally. 
194.  All fright has left him, while he identifies himself with the truth. 
195.  This truth of Creation and of the spirit, with which he is one, even directs his enemy's hand that will rise against him, in such a way that it falls back to (the enemy) himself. 
196.  The spiritual one is protected and sheltered, and the whole nature is well-disposed toward him, and yes, even his enemies have to serve him in the end. <br />
